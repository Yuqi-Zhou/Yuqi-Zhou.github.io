<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Intelligent Information Retrieval Lab ([IIR Lab](https://ruc-iir-lab.github.io/)) from the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence ([GSAI](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/)), Renmin University of China ([RUC](https://www.ruc.edu.cn)), supervised by Prof. [Jun Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=su14mcEAAAAJ). I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://www.hust.edu.cn)) in June 2023. My research interests include Tool Learning with Large Language Models, Recommender System, and Information Retrieval.
